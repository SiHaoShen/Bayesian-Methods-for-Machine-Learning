## Final project: Finding the suspect

[Facial composites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_composite) are widely used in forensics to generate images of suspects. Since victim or witness usually isn't good at drawing, computer-aided generation is applied to reconstruct the face attacker. One of the most commonly used techniques are evolutionary systems that compose the final face from many predefined parts.

In this project we will try to implement an app for creating facial composite that will be able to construct desired faces without explicitly providing databases of templates. We will apply Variational Autoencoders and Gaussian processes for this task.

Final project is developed in a way that you can apply learned techniques to real project yourself. We will include main guidelines and hints, but great part of the project will need your creativity and experience from previous assignments.
